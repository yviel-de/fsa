# Roles - yviel's FSA v0.3.0
Roles are the building blocks of FSA, each providing a different functionality.

They can be individually addressed using the `-r` or `--role` [fsa switch](../docs/FSA_CMD.md).

This is a collection of more complex usage examples involving multiple roles.

For smaller examples view the individual role pages, for the full reference [go here](../docs/REFERENCE.md).

Even more examples can be found in the [tests](../molecule/) that FSA goes through before release.

## DNS+DHCP Server + VPN Gateway
#### Description
This allows you to provide automagic adblock and VPN to any device on your network.

Some of this is usually done by your home-router - you'll have to manually turn off DHCP in its WebUI.

#### Roles used
 - [net](net/)
 - [dhcp](dhcp/)
 - [dns](dns/)
 - [vpn](vpn/)

#### Configuration
```yaml
# my_local_server
net:
  # we enable routing so that we start forwarding other devices' packets for them
  routing: true
  # we set the default route to be our remote vpn endpoint
  routes:
    - default 172.16.0.1
  ifaces:
    # dhcp server requires static interface configuration
    # this assumes a regular home network with the router at 192.168.0.1/24
    - name: eth0
      addr: 192.168.0.2
      netmask: 255.255.255.0
      # we enable the dhcp server for this interface
      dhcp:
        # the range in which to hand out ips
        - range: 192.168.0.16 192.168.0.192
          domain: home.myname.local
          # clients in this range will send their traffic to the router
          routers: 192.168.0.1
          # we will answer their dns queries (and adblock them)
          dnssrv: 192.168.0.2
        - range: 192.168.0.193 192.168.0.254
          domain: vpn.myname.local
          # clients in this range wil send their traffic to us
          routers: 192.168.0.2
          # we're resolving the dns queries for both ranges here
          dnssrv: 192.168.0.2
          # here we're denying unknown clients and specifying what should go through us ie VPN
          deny_unknown: true
          # and finally, our privileged clients for whom we VPN things
          leases:
            - name: myvpnclient
              ip: 192.168.0.200
              mac: 00:de:ad:be:ef:00
  dns:
    # we enable the dns server to listen on all
    # it adblocks by default
    listen:
      - 0.0.0.0
  vpn:
    # we set up a vpn connection to a fsa-managed vpn server
    type: wireguard
    # interface to use for the vpn traffic
    iface: eth0
    # address inside the vpn network
    addr: 172.16.0.2
    # keepalive since it's our default route
    keepalive: 20
    peer:
      # name of the vpn server (must be existing fsa host)
      name: myvpnserver
      # ip address of the vpn server
      addr: 93.184.216.34
```
```yaml
# my_vpn_server
net:
  # this guy also needs to forward our packets
  routing: true
  vpn:
    # the server-side configuration for this
    type: wireguard
    iface: eth0
    # vpn-internal ip
    addr: 172.16.0.1
    peers:
    # this is our local client
      - name: mylocalserver
        # with its vpn-internal ip
        addr: 172.16.0.2
```

## Full Mail Solution
